      ??)     if combobox is selected it stays there eventhough through

      ??)     Values changed in the tableview are not check if they are
              valid or not. need adding check for this in editOnCommit
              this is only an issue in the userlist. In the superusercarview
               the values we change to can only be valid because theyre
               checkedi n the usercarparts controller before being added
               to the jobj files.                                         done
